PageSpeedOff -- Google PageSpeed Disabler
=========================================

A simple toggle that will globally enable/disable the server-side PageSpeed module.

This works by setting an appropriate HTTP header on every request, as per [the documentation].

Generally one would not want to do something like this, but it can be very useful for some web site developers.
