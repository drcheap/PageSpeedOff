PageSpeedOff -- Google PageSpeed Disabler
=========================================

A simple toggle that will globally enable/disable the server-side PageSpeed module.

This works by setting an appropriate HTTP header as per [the documentation].

Generally one would not want to do something like this, but it can be very useful for some web site developers.

You can choose to toggle this behavior on all web sites, or on a per-site basis (default as of v2.0).
